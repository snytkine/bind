Try to create factory provided dependency named with "any" for class
Then inject it as UNNAMED injection into constructor
See if it works. There is a check in inject.ts around line 199 if (!injectClassName) {... throw
I think that may be a mistake, but maybe not a mistake.


TODO also try to setup parent class with ctor injection and child class with ctor injection
See how it works when ctor deps override ctor deps from parent.
- Allow @Inject as method param. In this case scope limitations will not apply.
